# ParentZonePhotoDownloader
A script to download photos from the gallery in ParentZone nursery app

To be clear, this project stands FIRMLY on the shoulders of Robin Wilsons' previous work, http://blog.rtwilson.com/automatically-downloading-nursery-photos-from-parentzone-using-selenium/ and the associated Git repo, https://github.com/robintw/ParentZonePhotoDownloader

Getting my code to run involves following Robin's instructions but just using my version of the script intead of his.

My version works with the ParentZone website as of September 2021, it may not work in the future because PZ might change things. Feel free to drop me a line if that's the case and I'll see what I can do but, I have no 'skin in the game' after this as my little lad has left nursery.

Anyway, I hope it works for you.
